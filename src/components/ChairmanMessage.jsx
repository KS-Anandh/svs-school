        <h3>Welcome to SVS School !</h3>
        <p>
          <span style={{color:"orangered",fontWeight:"bolder",marginLeft:"100px",fontSize:"18px"}}> At SVS School</span> , we believe that education is the most powerful tool to
          shape the future. Our mission is to nurture young minds with a strong
          foundation in knowledge, values, and creativity, preparing them to
          meet the challenges of a dynamic world.
        </p>
        <p>
          In todayâ€™s digital age, the classroom is no longer confined to four
          walls. Through innovative teaching, digital integration, and
          real-world learning, we are committed to creating a generation of
          thinkers, problem-solvers, and leaders. Our curriculum blends
          academics with life skills, sports, personality development, coding,
          robotics, and future-ready technologies like AI and drones.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Chairman, I am proud to lead a dedicated team of educators and
          visionaries who share a passion for shaping the leaders of tomorrow.
          Let us work together to empower every child to dream, discover, and
          achieve.
        </p>
        <h3>Warm regards,</h3>
